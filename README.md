## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm passionate about Extreme Programming (XP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). I firmly believe in the power of collaboration, continuous improvement, and delivering high-quality software that meets user needs.

With a focus on writing clean and maintainable code, and embracing the principles of XP and TDD, I strive to create software that not only meets requirements but also stands the test of time. My journey in software development revolves around iterating quickly, embracing feedback loops, and fostering a culture of shared responsibility within teams.

Feel free to explore my repositories and collaborate.
